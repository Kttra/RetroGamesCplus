# Retro Games in C++
Retro games implemented in C++ using the SFML Graphics package. I personally worked on the project using visual studio; however, the SFML Graphics package is compatible with other IDEs like CodeBlocks.

If the games don't launch for you, try to download and install the x86 and x64 versions of the multi-installer Visual C++ 2015, 2017 and 2019 redistributables at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

Because the programs are mainly implementations of their respective arcade game, some of the games do not have the same fail conditions, restart feature, or screen wraparound features.

**Controls**
------------
Most of the controls for the games are the game. Either left click to interact with the games or use the arrow keys and space bar to move or execute an action.

**Arkanoid**
------------
Arkanoid is a 1986 block breaker arcade game developed and published by Taito. The player has to prevent the ball from falling by commanding his ship that serves as the paddle.

**Snake**
-------------
Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself. The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries. Because snake is very easy to implement, you may have seen this game before.

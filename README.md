# Retro Games in C++
Retro games implemented in C++ using the SFML Graphics package.

If the games don't launch for you, try to download and install the x86 and x64 versions of the multi-installer Visual C++ 2015, 2017 and 2019 redistributables at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

Because the programs are mainly implementations of their respective arcade game, some of the games do not have the same fail conditions, restart feature, or screen wraparound features.
